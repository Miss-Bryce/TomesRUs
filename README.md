This is the Semi-Functional assignment piece done for 21S Server-Side Scripting-ASP.NET (COMP2084)
[I say semi since it's a barebones website.]

The purpose of this website is as follows:
1. To teach me about ASP.NET
2. To allow a user to access the 'used bookshop' I've made.

Currently you can just register, add books and authors, and navigate around.

It was made by me! Jillian Bryce 200440217
